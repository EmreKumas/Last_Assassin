# Last Assassin

  In a *post-apocalyptic* world, the world is not a good place for weaks to live. A disease has spread all across the world after the Nuclear War which turns people into mindless creatures called ***Zombies***. Only rich people can have a place in this world, and of course **warriors**. Our character is an *assassin* living in this world and do jobs for the living. So you have to complete the tasks you're given or you will *die*, too.
  
  This is the *story* of our game. We started to develop this game in our Computer Engineering intern. We only used a framework called *NgdroidApp*, but for the most of the features we wrote them from scratch. It tooks us 1 month to bring the game to this form. Even though we couldn't finish the game, it was a good experience. We wrote it in *Android Studio* and used *Java* as the programming language. Most of the assets were available on the internet for free use. Remaining assets (background for ex.) were done by us. We wrote about *3000 lines of code*. And as I said, even though we couldn't finish it, it was a good experience.
